### Description

A relatively simple whiteboard application that interacts with mouse, touches, and pointer devices. Keyboard shortcuts change colors quickly or switch tools. When you're done, you can easily download your masterpiece as a png.

This is built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
